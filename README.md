pynetstation
=======================

A native python library for communicating with the EGI netstation, based on the libnetstation project.

pynetstation was hosted on googlecode: https://code.google.com/p/pynetstation/

It was listed as GPL3 and I haven't managed to track down the original author:
    https://code.google.com/p/pynetstation/issues/detail?id=3

I've therefore moved it over to github to ensure that its existence is maintained, given an uncertain future of googlecode. 
I haven't personally developed the code, nor do I have an EGI system to test on so I can't provide much support other
than ensuring the files remain available
